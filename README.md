Below is a collection of my engineering, research, and software projects.  

<!-- Each project includes a brief description, representative visuals, and a link to detailed documentation. -->

## PRIME - Zero Gravity Flight Experiment
**Description:**  
PRIME is a microgravity fluid-dynamics payload for a LEAP rocket that studies liquid transfer between coupled tanks in zero gravity with C++ controlled flight sequencing.

## Aerospace Senior Design Project
**Description:**  
Designed and manufactured a 3.4 kg fixed-wing RC aircraft using Fusion 360, a Pixhawk flight controller, and MATLAB for sizing, aerodynamic, and stability analysis, achieving a successful 1.4 km flight at 14.5 m/s while delivering the project on time and 14% under budget.
